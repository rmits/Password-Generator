Here I include a gif of the working application, where once the generate password button is pressed, the user is then prompted to put how long they would like their generated password to be. If it does not meet the guidelines, the user is then brought back with an alert saying it did not meet the guidelines, and to try again. If the imput is empty, it alerts the user that it is empty, and they need to try again. Then there are 4 confirms the user is prompted with, whether they would like to incluse uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numeric characters, or special characters. Once all these inputs are met, the password is then generated in the text box.
